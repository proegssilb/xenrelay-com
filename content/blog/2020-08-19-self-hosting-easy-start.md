We should probably talk about some options for how people actually self-host. There's certainly easier and harder
options. The main things I'll talk about today are Synology, Cloudron, Sandstorm, and chaotic cramming. Each person has
their own needs and preferences, so there is no "best answer" here. I'll try to speak to what sort of people might like
each option too.
