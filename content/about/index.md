You've met those people with a thousand ideas and not enough time to work on
them. The author of this site, is one of those people. You
can view some of his projects on [Github](https://github.com/proegssilb)
or [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/minifig404) (warning: Lots of works-in-progress).

For now, enjoy the slow-moving [blog](/posts/). Maybe a new post will happen
once a week, maybe once every other year. Life has a tendency of happening to
all of us.
