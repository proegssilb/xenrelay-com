<br />Maybe you've seen the xkcd comic? For those who haven't:
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png" width="281" alt="An xkcd comic about python and antigravity." /></a>
</div>Did you know that Python 3.0 and later have such a module? Open up your favorite Python terminal, and try this:
<br />
<blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">import antigravity</span></blockquote>Python has, from day one, been a light-hearted language. Read the online Python documentation long enough, and you'll notice a number of Monty Python references,
in honor of Python's namesake. The people behind Python (including the Benevolent Dictator for Life) have designed it to be a simple and powerful language
<br />Where am I going with this? I am one of the many people who think Python is an awesome language, with an entertaining history. The purpose of the CSSE120 Tangents series is to give me a place to preach about some of the inner workings of Python that the
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Computer Science curriculum won't address directly for a while. There are some topics that I will try to avoid talking about, because you will find out about very closely related material soon enough.
<br />
<br />I hope that some Computer Science majors enjoy reading about Python.
