So far, I've been looking through the assignments, trying to see if there are topics I can say more about, or if there are exercises that could be done another way. I've covered a good amount of this already, and I won't have some more topics to talk about for another couple of weeks. So, is there anything the students of 120 would like to see me write a post about in the mean time?<br /><br />This can be exercises that seemed longer than they needed to be, things that just required too roundabout of code, ideas that you still find confusing, or anything else about Python that isn't going to get taught before Junior year.
